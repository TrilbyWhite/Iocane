\fB\-c\fP\fI command\-string\fP
 Execute command\-string. Multiple commands can be placed on the command line with multiple \fB\-c\fP

contains spaces they must be escaped or quoted. If any \fB\-c\fP
commands are specified, iocane

.TP
\fIfilename\fP
 Specify an optional iocane
script file from which to read commands.

.SH CONFIGURATION

In interactive mode, runtime configuration is read from the following files, in order, stopping at the first file found: 
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/iocane/config,
$HOME/.iocanerc,
/usr/share/iocane/iocanerc\&.
.PP
Each non\-empty, non\-comment line in a configuration file specifies a \fIkey\fP
and a \fIcommand\-string\fP\&.
Any X11 keysym can be used for \fIkey\fP\&.
.PP
.SH COMMANDS

.PP
The following \fIcommand\-string\fPs
can be entered in the configuration file to be bound to a key, specified as an option to a \fB\-c\fP
flag on the command line, sent to iocane\&'s
stdin, or entered one per line in a script with a #!/bin/iocane shebang. Any command can also be specified by first letter.
